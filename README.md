# Word-Guess-Game
This is a compact version of the hangman game which comes with most of the critical game features that the hangman game has got except for the sound play functionality.

The logic behind the game is just as straightforward in that players only needs to individually type in the correct letters to match the spelling of the animal on guess.  

Player can press any button to start the game. When game starts, the player presses any buttons on the keyboard (a-z letters) and the computer will display if the key letters typed in forms part of the animal's name. For every single animal on guess, player may have up to 5 chances to type in the wrong letters before game restarts (failure of the game). 

Game stats are at the bottom of the game page which will indicate some live game progress data. 

Each round if the player successfully typed in the right animal's name, the correspondent animal's picture will show up on the right hand side of the page. Once the four animals were all guessed on, congratulation info will be displayed on the panel, however player may still choose to play again.
